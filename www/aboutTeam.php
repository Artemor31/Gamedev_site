					As a User Experience (UX) Designer, I build the practices and strategies for how our games will be presented and interact with players. First, we determine the kind of experience we want to give the player, then we create it, test it and then tweak it to perfection. It requires a lot of understanding about human behavior, psychology, culture, emotion, context, flow, interfaces, performance and scope.

					I believe life is too short - that’s why I decided to work on successful games that will change players’ lives.

					I bring things to life. Whether it’s a monster, a hero or an object, it goes from a statue-like state to an animated wonder. What’s wonderful about being an animator is that we are director, cameraman and actor all at the same time. An animator wants to master the art of movement in all its beautiful nuances, even if the task is a simple walking loop animation. And then there are the swordplay sequences, dramatic cinematics and comedic cut scenes. And on top of all that, every project has its own style, from hyper-realistic to cartoony!
